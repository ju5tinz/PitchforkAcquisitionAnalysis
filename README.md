# PitchforkAcquisitionAnalysis


Pitchfork is an online magazine that was started in 1999 with the focus of reviewing music in the independent music scene. On October 13, 2015 Pitchfork was aquired by media giant Conde Nast. As a long time fan of Pitchfork, I am concerned that this acquisition may have resulted in reviews that are more biased or dishonest.

In this project we'll analyze the reviews published by Pitchfork before and after the acquisition to determine if there are any changes in the reviews.
